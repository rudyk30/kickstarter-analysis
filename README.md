From this report, we clearly see Theatre kickstarter campaigns are more likely to be successfull. In addition, the best months to start a kickstarter is May as there is a sharp decline in successful campaigns afterwards. In order to have a shot at a successful campagin, Louise should focus on starting her campaign in late April and focus on starting a play that will fit in the Theatre category.
